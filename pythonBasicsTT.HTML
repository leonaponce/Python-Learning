<h1>Team TreeHouse Python Basics</h1>

<h2>Running Scripts</h2>
  <p>EXAMPLE 
    print("Hello, World")
  
    This is a <strong>script</strong> because its passed 
    to the Python interpreter, which reads the script line by line. It then interprets meaning from the script and then perform it.</p>

    We can run the script to the Python interpreter by typing the following within the console:

         python hello.py

    "hello.py" refers to the name of the script


<h2>The Python Shell</h2>
  <p>Python's version of a REPL, commonly used across many progamming languages. Pronounced [rep-yl]. An exploratory prompt that allows you to type Python code
    line by line. This is super handy when you just wanna see what some code does, and not actually go and create a whole script. 
    REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.</p>
