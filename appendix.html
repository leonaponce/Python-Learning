agile=quick deplyoment and feedback cycle;  a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. 
  This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. 
  It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.

bash - Bash is a command shell that runs on many Mac, Linux, and even some Windows computers when you open their terminals.
console - This is a tool that sends low level commands to your Operating System (macOS / Windows / Linux).

chevrons - indicator wjhere we can start writing code (>>>)
cURL - a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various protocols.
  It was first released in 1997. The name stands for "Client URL".

executable - e.g. "git" in a git command

flask - is a micro web framework written in Python.
  It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where 
  pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions 
  that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. 

high-level command= abstracts away a lot of the details, putting the knowledge in the tool. 
  This normally makes them much easier to use. The downside is sometimes they just can't do what you want, 
  because you want something weird. Or when something goes wrong, it can be hard to figure out why it's not working.

intelisense=

interpreter - The program that will read and execute our script.

kernel -

low-level command=losest to the raw data, to the kernel interface, etc. 
  The benefit is that when using one, you have a lot of control. 
  This can be useful when something breaks, or you need to do something weird. 
  The output of low-level commands are often easier to parse with scripts, too (a lot of times, that's what they're intended for). 
  The downside is, you have to know what you're doing. 
  The tools contain almost no knowledgeâ€”it all needs to be in your head (or notes in front of you...).

microframework - used to refer to minimalistic web application frameworks. 
  It is contrasted with full-stack frameworks. Lacks most of the functionality 
  which is common to expect in a full-fledged web application framework, such as:

    Accounts, authentication, authorization, roles, etc.
    Database abstraction via an object-relational mapping.
    Input validation and input sanitation.
    Web template engine.
  
  Typically, a microframework facilitates receiving an HTTP request, routing the HTTP request to the appropriate controller, 
  dispatching the controller, and returning an HTTP response. Microframeworks are often specifically designed for building the APIs for another service or application. 
  For example, Lumen microframework is designed for Microservices development and API development.
  
script - The file we are writing that the Python interpreter will run.

SSH key=

SQL= the most well-known and widely-used query language, is familiar to most database administrators (DBAs).

queries= A query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. This data may be generated as 
  results returned by Structured Query Language (SQL) or as pictorials, graphs or complex results, e.g., trend analyses for data-mining tools.
  One of several different query languages may be used to perform a range of simple to complex database queries.
