Git is now the world's most popular version control system (VCS), with close to 70% of developers using it.
Makes backups of projects and allows devs to collab 

The collection of all the old versions of your project's files is known as a Git repository. It's basically just a folder in which you can edit your files, then run Git commands to store your changes.

Commit = version of ur project stored in repo
Commands

    git clone and git init - set up new repositories

    git add - used when committing new versions of files.

    git status -used when committing new versions of files.

    git commit - used when committing new versions of files.

    git log - lets you view a list of your old commits.

    git mv and git rm - move and remove files that are being tracked by Git. 

    git push and git pull - synchronize commits with Git repositories on other computers. 

    git ignore

    HEAD

    git reset HEAD~1

    git --help

    git push -f origin *branch name here* = Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref
      that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This flag disables the check. 
      This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.

Terms

Upstream = When you make changes, you usually want to send them back "upstream" so they make it into that repository 
  so that everyone pulling from the same source is working with all the same changes. You want to get your changes into the main project
  so you're not tracking divergent lines of development. There is no absolute upstream repo or downstream repo.
  Those notions are always relative between two repos and depends on the way data flows:

    If "yourRepo" has declared "otherRepo" as a remote one, then:
    
    -you are pulling from upstream "otherRepo" ("otherRepo" is "upstream from you", and you are "downstream for otherRepo").
    -you are pushing to upstream ("otherRepo" is still "upstream", where the information now goes back to).
    *Note the "from" and "for": you are not just "downstream", you are "downstream from/for", hence the relative aspect.

Downstream = when one copies (clone, checkout, etc.) from a repository. 
  Information is flowed "downstream" to you.

Working Tree = a directory, which includes files and subdirectories, associated with a repository. 
  Here you can add new files, edit existing files, or remove extraneous files. You access the working 
  tree whenever you open files for a project managed as a Git repository.
